# Diceware

>Diceware is a method for creating passphrases,   
passwords, and other cryptographic variables   
using ordinary dice as a hardware random number   
generator.      
>
>For each word in the passphrase, five rolls of   
a six-sided die are required. The numbers from  
1 to 6 that come up in the rolls are assembled   
as a five-digit number, e.g. 43146.  That number   
is then used to look up a word in a cryptographic   
word list. In the original Diceware list 43146   
corresponds to `munch`. By generating several   
words in sequence, a lengthy passphrase can thus   
be constructed randomly.
